        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
          Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods are a family of likelihood-free methods for estimating the posterior of model parameters. These methods have many features which users need to specify for each problem the methods are used on, and on which the success of these methods rests. In this project, I explore methods for automating the selection of one of these features: summary statistics. I provide an analysis of what creates a desirable summary statistic and discuss methods to automate their selection. Two types of selection method are discussed: those which choose an optimal set of statistics from a larger set of handcrafted statistics; and, those which generate their own summary statistics. I implement these methods and evaluate their ability to fit SIR models to data from the early stages of the SARS-CoV-19 (Covid-19) outbreaks in both France and Senegal, with results showing that these selection methods are able to select summary statistics which, when paired with an ABC method, are able to produce better fitting models than the na&#239;vely optimal identity function.

    <h3>Implementing & Evaluating Space Efficient Algorithms for Detecting Large Neighbourhoods in Graph Streams.</h3>

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
          The Neighbourhood Detection Problem is a problem in graph theory which tasks one with finding a vertex in the graph which has a certain number of neighbours and to then return a subset of these neighbours. This is a trivial problem to solve in theory, but in practice is hard to solve within a time frame which makes the implementation practical. A major reason for this is that many approaches to solving the problem require a lot of space and so quickly overflow a computerâ€™s RAM, slowing the execution significantly down. This common space inefficiency is becoming increasingly problematic since the move towards Big Data. In this paper I discuss and implement the two algorithms presented in <a class="external_link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08832" target="_blank">[1]</a> which offer space efficient solutions for neighbourhood detection for two types of graph stream. During the implementation I discuss and evaluate several methods for improving performance of these algorithms, focusing on space-efficiency in order to maximise the potential size of graphs the implementations are effective on. The final implementation of the proposed algorithm for insertion-only streams proves very promising with it able to find large neighbourhoods in a couple of minutes for a graph with 30 million edges. The algorithm for insertion-deletion streams proves much more difficult to evaluate due to restrictions incurred from the implementation of L0 samplers.

    <h3>The effect of the depreciation of the pound sterling on the travel and tourism industry</h3>

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
          I was member of the 2019-20 ONS University Working Group. This involved sessions with memebers of staff an the ONS's Newport. I worked with four other undergrads to produce a report on 'The effect of the depreciation of the pound sterling on the travel and tourism industry' in which I focused on the accomodation chapter. This project was presented to staff at the ONS for which we recived a recommendation for a placement.

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
          I began running in October 2018. Throughout this period I have recoreded data for each run, namely GPS & heart rate, which I have been playing around with.
          I produced an infographic outlining the training I did leading into doing the Derby Half Marathon in 2019, my first half marathon.
          Currently I am working on some properiaty software to analyse my generated data and I should hopefully have something to present soon.
