    <h1>Technology Analyst Intern</h1>
    <h2>Barclays Execution Services</h2>
    <h3>2019 & 2020</h3>
    <p>Two ten-week interships with Barclaycard in Northampton*, working as a technology analyst. My keytake aways from these programs was in the processes which underpin the development of technology projects at such a large business, especially the necessesity of documentation and ensuring stakeholders considered in all decisions. </p>
    <p>During my first internship, I ran a project to taxonimise the technologies used by Barclaycard Commercial Payments (BCP) department. And, in my second internship I was part of the Retail and Business Lending Technology team and created a "requirements and delivery management" pack for a PSD2 article</p>
    <p>In both internships I partook in sessions to understand the structure and departments of the businesses. As well as organise two different charity events, rasing Â£600 for FareShare.</p>
    <p>I was offered a place on the company's 2021 graduate scheme, but decided to persue other opportunities.</p>
